# Contributing

This project is just a starter template/reference for building a blog with Appwrite. More features are appreciated only if they are useful for beginners. Any kind of bug fixes or documentation improvements are also welcome.

## How to Start?

You can find an in-depth guide to setting up Appwrite [here](docs/appwrite.md). This guide will help you set up Appwrite using their cloud service, as well as their self-hosted solution. The project uses `Next.js` for the frontend, you can learn more about it [here](https://nextjs.org/docs).
